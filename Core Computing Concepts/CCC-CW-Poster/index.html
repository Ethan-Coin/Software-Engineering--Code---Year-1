                <h2>Ethical Framework Selection</h2>
                <p>When designing an algorithm for self-driving cars it is important to consider an ethical framework. Selecting the right ethical framework will provide an optimal route which can guarantee both speed and safety. The ethical framework that I have chosen is the utilitarianism framework.

                <h3>Utilitarianism</h3>
                <p>Is an ethical framework whose fundamental principle is the "greatest happiness principle." This principle states that the right action is the one that maximises utility. Utility is defined as the sum of all the happiness that results from an action, minus the suffering of anyone involved in the action.
                </p>
                <p class="gap">The reason that I have chosen this framework is because it is the most logical framework. It is the framework that will result in the most happiness for the most people. By utilising utilitarianism, we can assign a numerical value to each edge in the graph, which will represent the risk involved in taking that traversal. The scale will be from 1 to 5, with 1 being the safest and 5 being the most dangerous. Hence, by performing an algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find the optimal route that will result in the most happiness for the majority.

                <h2>Generalisability</h2>
                <p>As shown by the images, towns one and two both show
                    their own optimised paths found by the algorithm. This
                    algorithm can be used in any town as long as it follows
                    the same rules as the two towns shown. The rules are as
                    follows: has three different colours (green, blue, and red),
                    has a starting point and an endpoint, has a path between
                    each node and has no dead ends. As shown in the example on
                    The right is a town, which I created to show that the
                    algorithm can be used in any town.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>By using utilitarianism, I have developed an algorithm that will create a graph from a town. Creates the distance weightings and the risk weightings. Then it combines these two weights into another weight. By using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path with the combined weight. It will output the fastest and safest path for the self-driving car to drive down.</p>
